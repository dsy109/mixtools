### Synopsis

The [mixtools package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=mixtools) provides functions for analyzing finite mixture models.  Parametric and semiparametric mixture models are handled.  Various tools are include for determining the number of components.   Visualizations include histograms with the estimated mixture model overlaid, 2D and 3D scatterplots for relevant mixture fits, and the [mixturegram](https://doi.org/10.1080/10618600.2017.1398093).    More details about the package are included in both the original [JSS](http://dx.doi.org/10.18637/jss.v032.i06) article as well as a technical report on the open archive [HAL](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00717545/document).

Other highlights:

- Includes estimation of various parametric and semiparametric mixtures-of-regressions models.

- Functions to help with determining the number of components, including bootstrapping the likelihood ratio test statistic, mixturegrams, and model selection criteria.

- Functions available for estimating Reliability Mixture Models (RMMs).

- Includes a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for estimating a mixture-of-linear-regressions model.

- Includes some real datasets for which mixture models have been shown to provide good fits.

### Documentation

The [JSS](http://dx.doi.org/10.18637/jss.v032.i06) article and the technical report on [HAL](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00717545/document) both provide documentation about the mixtools package.  Moreover, the [help file](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mixtools) also documents the references used for each function.

### Examples

Additional examples for the mixtools package are currently being developed for a Shiny app.

### Installation

Released and tested versions of mixtools are available via the
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) network, and can be installed from within R via

```R
install.packages("mixtools")
```

### Support

The [issue tickets at the GitHub repo](https://github.com/dsy109/mixtools/issues)
are the primary bug reporting interface.  As with the other web resources,
previous issues can be searched as well.
